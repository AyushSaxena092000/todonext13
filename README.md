"I'm developing an application using Next.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. MongoDB serves as the database management system. This project marks my debut with Next.js, and I'm focusing on simplicity as I build it out. I plan to gradually add more projects built with Next.js and Node.js to showcase my skills and expertise in web development."
